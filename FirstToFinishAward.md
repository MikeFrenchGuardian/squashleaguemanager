How I'm going to go about making the first to finish award

1. Get the number of required matches for each player in each division.

> function getRequiredMatches($division,$seasonID)

2. Get the number of matches people played in each division

> function getLeagueGamesPlayed($playerID,$seasonID)

3. if 1 == 2 get the last ID of the matches played in that season for those players:

> function      getLastMatch()


4. Find the player with the lowest ID and award them with something amazing.

array sort of some kind i guess.
